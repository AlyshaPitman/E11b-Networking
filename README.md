# E11b-Networking
A simple example of a HTTP request in Godot.

This should be a super-simple opportunity for you to see how to make a HTTP request from within Godot. For this example, we will be using a JSON testing tool: [jsontest.com](http://www.jsontest.com)

As usual, fork and clone this repository. It is pretty empty to start with. When it has been cloned to your computer, open the project.godot file.
